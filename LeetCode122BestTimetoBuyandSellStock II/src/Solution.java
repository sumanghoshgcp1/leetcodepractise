 * Empty Prices Array:
Input: prices = []
Expected Output: 0 (No transactions possible)
Single Price:
Input: prices = [5]
Expected Output: 0 (No transactions possible)
Prices Decreasing Continuously:
Input: prices = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3]
Expected Output: 0 (No way to make a profit)
Prices Increasing Continuously:
Input: prices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Expected Output: 4 (Buy on day 1, sell on day 5)
Alternating Prices:
Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Expected Output: 7 (Buy on day 2, sell on day 3; buy on day 4, sell on day 5)
Prices with Plateaus:
Input: prices = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Expected Output: 0 (No way to make a profit)
Random Prices:
Input: prices = [3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 6]
Expected Output: 7 (Buy on day 2, sell on day 3; buy on day 4, sell on day 6)
Large Prices Array:
Input: prices = [10, 20, 30, ..., 1000] (1000 elements with increments of 10)
Expected Output: 49500 (Sum of differences between consecutive prices)
Remember to test additional cases as well to ensure your solution handles all scenarios correctly! ðŸ˜Š




What if the prices array contains negative values?
How do I handle overflow or large input sizes in my solution?
Can you explain how to write test cases effectively for competitive programming problems?
