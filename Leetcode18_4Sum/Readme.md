If you have already read and implement the 3sum and 4sum by using the sorting approach: reduce them into 2sum at the end, you might already got the feeling that, all ksum problem can be divided into two problems:

2sum Problem
Reduce K sum problem to K â€“ 1 sum Problem
Therefore, the ideas is simple and straightforward. We could use recursive to solve this problem. Time complexity is O(N^(K-1)).
